Version 1.5.8:


Version 1.5.7:
	* For RedHat based distributions which rely on `epel`, the user can now pass `testing` to the 
	script and `epel-testing` shall be used to bootstrap salt and it's dependencies.
	* No full system upgrades, if optional by the distribution, shall be done unless `-U` is passed 
	to the bootstrap script(required upgrade procedures must exist on the script, currently Debian 
	and RedHat based distributions support system upgrades).
	* Fixed an issue where passing BS_KEEP_TEMP_FILES=1 to the script was causing an error. #206.
	* Switched FreeBSD default packages repository to PCBSD(http://www.pcbsd.org) and added 
	multiple repository support to install salt from the SaltStack's FreeBSD repository.  Thanks 
	Christer Edwards(cedwards).
	* Improved Gentoo Support. Thanks Elias Probst(eliasp).
	* Stop execution soon for end of life distributions or non supported distribution versions.
	* Distro Support Fixed:
		* Fixed an unbound variable while bootstraping Gentoo.
		* Fixed CentOS/RHEL 5.
		* Fixed crypto++ compilation. Thanks Kenneth Wilke(KennethWilke)!
		* Fixed FreeBSD git installations not pointing to the proper salt configuration directory, 
		which on FreeBSD is '/usr/local/etc/salt'.
		* Fixed testing installation for Red Hat based distributions. Thanks Jeff Strunk(jstrunk)
		* Fixed wrong package name on Arch. Thanks Niels Abspoel(aboe76)
		* Make sure the Ubuntu universe repository is enabled. Thanks Karl Grzeszczak(karlgrz).
		* Fixed SmartOS installation. Thanks Matthieu Guegan(mguegan).

Version 1.5.6:
	* If there's a `grains` file on the provided temporary configuration directory, move it to the 
	proper place while moving the minion configuration file.
	* Gentoo bootstraps can now use a bin host to provide binary packages, just set the 
	`BS_GENTOO_USE_BINHOST` environment variable.
	* If `BS_KEEP_TEMP_FILES=1` is found on the environment, the script will copy the files instead 
	of moving them.
	* There were still some `mv` and `cp` occurrences which were not using their `{move,copy}file` 
	replacements which ended up on now respecting the "Do not override existing configuration" 
	feature.
	* Distro Support Fixed:
		* Arch now upgrades it's system package properly as suggested on their mailing list.
		* Arch now moves back any configuration files provided by the user renamed by pacman on the 
		installation process.
		* Fixed SmartOS detection(was being detected as Solaris) and bootstrapping. Fixed SmartOS 
		different gcc package names for different package sets.
		* Fixed FreeBSD git based installations(no rc.d scripts were available).
		* Fixed FreeBSD not re-evaluating the `PKI_DIR` variable since the `SALT_ETC_DIR` was 
		redefined.
	* Distro Support Added:
		* Linux Mint. Thanks Alex Van't Hof(alexvh)!
		* Linaro.


Version 1.5.5:
	* Fixed a variable error in the new pre-seed feature.
	* Fixed the destination path to where the pre-seed minions keys should be copied.
	* Debian installations now use SaltStack's repository.

		unstable).
		* Ubuntu Lucid Daily PPA
		* SmartOS no longer ignores $SALT_ETC_DIR. Matthieu Guegan!
		* FreeBSD no longer ignores $SALT_ETC_DIR. Thanks Geoff Garside!
		* FreeBSD does not try to install pkgng if pkg is installed. Thanks Geoff Garside!
		* SunOS (Make use of XPG4 binaries on SunOS). Thanks Matthieu Guegan!
		* openSUSE (Don't fail if only one of the repositories failed to update)
		* Arch (Fixed the GPG issues for git installations)
	* Distro Support Added:
		* Gentoo. Thanks kaithar!


Version 1.5.4:
	* Fixed an issue we had when /proc/cpuinfo had more than one CPU. Detected on AMD CPUs.
	* OpenSUSE 12.3 uses lsb_release. Fix the returned distro name "openSUSE project" to "openSUSE" 
	which the script handles.
	* Added an custom move function which will only override if required and if we permit it.
	* Implemented the necessary function to pre-seed minion keys on a salt master as an optional 
	argument.
