	is still missing for FreeBSD and SmartOS.

	and RedHat based distributions support system upgrades).
	* Fixed an issue where passing BS_KEEP_TEMP_FILES=1 to the script was causing an error. #206.
	* Switched FreeBSD default packages repository to PCBSD(http://www.pcbsd.org) and added 
	multiple repository support to install salt from the SaltStack's FreeBSD repository.  Thanks 
	Christer Edwards(cedwards).

	of moving them.
