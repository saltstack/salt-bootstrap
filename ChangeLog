        subscription is being managed externally.

    * The script now allows setting up the salt-master address as a separate configuration file by
    passing `-A` to the script.
    * Add support to install apache-libcloud by passing the `-L` flag. In some distribution it's
    also needed to pass `-P` because the minimal apache-libcloud version is `0.14.0`. This support
    is still missing for FreeBSD and SmartOS.
    * Fixed an issue when copying or moving files. We now test to see if the destination is a

Version 1.5.8:
    * Fixed an Ubuntu regression. `add-apt-repository` is only available on
    `software-properties-common` after 12.10, inclusive. Thanks Diego Woitasen(diegows)

Version 1.5.7:
    * For RedHat based distributions which rely on `epel`, the user can now pass `testing` to the
    script and `epel-testing` shall be used to bootstrap salt and it's dependencies.
    * No full system upgrades, if optional by the distribution, shall be done unless `-U` is passed
    to the bootstrap script(required upgrade procedures must exist on the script, currently Debian
    and RedHat based distributions support system upgrades).
    * Fixed an issue where passing BS_KEEP_TEMP_FILES=1 to the script was causing an error. #206.
    * Switched FreeBSD default packages repository to PCBSD(http://www.pcbsd.org) and added
    multiple repository support to install salt from the SaltStack's FreeBSD repository.  Thanks

    proper place while moving the minion configuration file.

    `BS_GENTOO_USE_BINHOST` environment variable.
    * If `BS_KEEP_TEMP_FILES=1` is found on the environment, the script will copy the files instead
    of moving them.
    * There were still some `mv` and `cp` occurrences which were not using their `{move,copy}file`
    replacements which ended up on now respecting the "Do not override existing configuration"
    feature.
    * Distro Support Fixed:
        * Arch now upgrades it's system package properly as suggested on their mailing list.
